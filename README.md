## Introduction

HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of tags and attributes. This repository aims to cover fundamental HTML concepts and provide practical examples to reinforce learning.

## Getting Started

If you're new to HTML, start by exploring the basics. You can create an HTML file using a simple text editor like Notepad or a more advanced code editor like Visual Studio Code. Open your HTML file in a web browser to see how it renders.

## Basic HTML Structure

Learn about the basic structure of an HTML document, including the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, HTML!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## HTML Elements

Explore various HTML elements such as headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), and more.

## Attributes

Understand how attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. Learn about commonly used attributes like `id`, `class`, `href`, `src`, and `alt`.

## Links and Images

Create hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag and embed images into your web pages using the `<img>` tag.

## Lists

Use HTML to create ordered lists (`<ol>`), unordered lists (`<ul>`), and definition lists (`<dl>`).

## Tables

Learn how to structure tabular data using the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` tags.

## Forms

Explore form elements such as `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and `<button>` for user input.

## Semantic HTML

Discover the importance of semantic HTML and how to use elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to improve accessibility and SEO.

## Best Practices

Follow best practices for writing clean and maintainable HTML code, including indentation, comments, and use of semantic elements.
